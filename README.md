## BananaEconomics: A History
  I have multiple projects in the works, including a machine learning phishing detection model for conducting a content analysis and a discord text-to-game input bot, but as of right now, this is the project that has had the most impact on others, and the project that I think people have enjoyed the most, so I figured I'd release it! One day as I was working on PSET9 finance, some friends asked what I was doing, and then we began to have a conversation about the website, the stock market, and how it would be a fun competitive thing to do. After a few emails, lots of debugging and error testing, a little frustration and googling, I ended up with BananaEconomic$, my personalized take on the CS50 Finance website!
## BananaEconomics: A Breakdown
  #### CS50 PSET9 Functionality
  The CS50 team was kind enough to provide me with a starting point, giving me a css file which I used, a layout file which I made some slight edits to, and an application file and some HTML templates, where I did most of my programming.

## Credits
A special thanks to the CS50 team for getting me started on my coding journey! I'd never be where I was without you.
Thanks to Toby Fox, for making Deltarune chapter 1 and 2, which I referenced and used media from throughout (Seen in the static folder).
Thanks to my friends, for helping me test and debug my website, catching many errors that I would've overlooked otherwise.
