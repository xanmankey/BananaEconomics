## Credits
A special thanks to the CS50 team for getting me started on my coding journey! I'd never be where I was without you.
Thanks to Toby Fox, for making Deltarune chapter 1 and 2, which I referenced and used media from throughout (Seen in the static folder).
Thanks to my friends, for helping me test and debug my website, catching many errors that I would've overlooked otherwise.
  
(I still need to make sure that my prize for completing all the achievements works!)
